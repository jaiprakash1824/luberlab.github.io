        We study the neurobiology of energy balance. Using cutting-edge
        approaches, we are working to understand the molecular, cellular, and
        circuit mechanisms through which the brain regulates food intake and
        energy expenditure. We are also developing novel technologies to better
        understand how the brain effects changes in behavior and physiology.
